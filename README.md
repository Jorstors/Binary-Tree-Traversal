# Binary-Tree-Traversal
A program that showcases different traversal methods for a binary search tree.

This is my first encounter with trees as make my way into the world of graph theory. I've implemented a tree class in which once constructed with a vector, a binary search tree is made using the middle most number as the root. Then, using four common methods of traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order), I print out node data in each order.
